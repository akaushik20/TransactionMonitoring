# Transaction Monitoring Model Analysis

A Python-based tool for analyzing transaction monitoring alert data, focusing on False Positive Rate (FPR) analysis and model effectiveness evaluation.

## What It Does

The `main.py` script performs end-to-end analysis of transaction monitoring alerts:

1. **Data Loading** - Reads alert data from CSV based on config.yaml
2. **False Positive Rate Analysis** - Calculates FPR by alert type, customer risk tier, and country
3. **Interactive Plotly Report** - Generates an HTML dashboard with visualizations
4. **EDA Report** - Creates a comprehensive data profiling report using ydata-profiling

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## File Locations

### Input
| File | Location |
|------|----------|
| Alert Data | `data/tm_alert_data_updated.csv` |
| Configuration | `config.yaml` |

### Output
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `transaction_monitoring_analysis.html` | Interactive Plotly dashboard |
| `EDA_report.html` | Comprehensive data profiling report |
| `false_positive_analysis_report.txt` | Text summary of FPR metrics |

## Output Reports

### 1. Transaction Monitoring Analysis (`transaction_monitoring_analysis.html`)
An interactive HTML dashboard with 4 sections:
- **Section 1**: False Positive Rate by alert type, customer risk tier, and country
- **Section 2**: Time to disposition analysis (average + distribution by alert type)
- **Section 3**: True Positive Rate by alert amount range
- **Section 4**: Heatmap of TPR by country and customer risk tier

### 2. EDA Report (`EDA_report.html`)
A detailed data profiling report generated by ydata-profiling, including:
- Dataset overview and statistics
- Variable distributions and correlations
- Missing value analysis
- Data quality alerts
